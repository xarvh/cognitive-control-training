- Causality: I'm told it might work by friends/media/academics.
- Anxiety:
  - I don't trust it because its new and I don't know if there is supporting evidence.
  - If I do the exercises I won't feel any better, I'll just feel frustrated.
- Motivation: I'll try anything to feel better.

## Needs
- I need to know why I should do these exercises.
- I need to feel safe, private, respected.
- I need to get positive feedback from the exercises, and want to continue doing them.
- I need to be able to do the exercises every day.

## Workflow
- Explain the theory and show authoritative evidence.
- Make the user feel secure by explaining that their results aren't collected.
- Teach the user how to do an exercise.
- Unobtrusively enable the user to complete the exercise again and again.
- Provide feedback on the user's progress, and be supportive of their results.
- Let the user change between exercises (repeat learn, do, feedback).
