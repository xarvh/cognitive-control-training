# Exercises UX Research

## User Story
When I try exercises to help with my depression I want to have an exercise that I can do that will help as much as possible so I can live a normal life.

## How people solve the problem now
When I try exercises to help with my depression I run them in clunky antique software so that I can do my exercises and live a normal life.
- Causality: I'm told it might work by academics, or I have already seen results.
- Anxiety:
  - That I won't be able to use the software.
  - That I won't be able to stick to the exercises for long enough to see results.
- Motivation: I'm told that completing the exercises will help me live a normal life.

## How we might solve this problem
When I try exercises to help with my depression I can complete them anywhere, and the app encourages me to keep doing them so that I can stick to them and live a normal life.
- Causality: Either referral or research.
- Anxiety:
  - The exercises are not doable.
  - I won't be able to stick with it long enough for it to help.
  - The app might track me.
- Motivation: I'm told that completing the exercises will help me live a normal life.

## Needs
- I need encouragement so that I keep using the app past the initial frustration.
- I need to be able to use the app for extended periods without hurting my eyes.
- I need the exercises to work on any device and be accessibility friendly.
- I need to be able to complete the tasks effectively (audio in my own language and other exercise specific concerns).
- I need to be able to use it without an internet connection.


## Workflow
- Present the exercise instructions, a button to start, and optional settings.
- The instructions teach the user how to complete the exercise, and explain why it helps.
- Settings all have the most common case as default, changes are persistent without compromising privacy.
- The exercise begins when the user presses the start button, so they can ignore the instructions and just start if they already know how to perform the exercise.
- Let the user perform the exercise without getting in their way (settings, instructions etc all disappear once exercise has started).
- Give the user supportive feedback on the exercise after they complete it.
