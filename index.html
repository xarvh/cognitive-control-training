  <h1>Cognitive Tasks</h1>
  <p>
    The tasks available from this page are used for cognitive exercises.
    <br> A relevant bibliography will be hopefully added soon.
    <br> For any technical issues, please <a href='https://github.com/xarvh/'>contact me from my github page</a>.
    <br> These pages are undergoing heavy development, expect things to change without notice.
    <br>
    <br> Please note that no data will be sent to any server, so if you leave a Task's page without downloading the results, the data will be lost.
